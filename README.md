Project Title

Jared's Cellar
Description

This is a static website which allows viewing of this business' details such as an "about me" section, viewing of the menu, and creating table reservations. For this project, HTML was used to add needed content and details for the customer, CSS was used to make this site beautiful, and a tad of Javascript was used to populate a message once all input field have been entered. In the future, I my consider changing the CSS to make menu more visual on smaller devices.
